# CryptoClusteringRework
### Utilized the solutions provided in class as guidance to further understand how to implement the KMeans algorithm model successfully. ChatGPT and Claude AI, along with the Xpert AI from BCS, assisted with clarifying coding and explaining error output mitigation. The original Repo sent had to be deleted due to a file directory issue that prevented me from further processing cells in the jupyter notebook. That eventually was resolved with the rendition of the new Repo titled 'CryptoClusteringRework.'
